# insurance-analysis

## description
This project is an introduction project into data science fundamentals. It reviews basic python knowledge and analyses a csv dataset containing insurance information.

## Goals

1. General Information
Firstly, I want to provide general information about the dataset. This includes information about the distribution of certain variables.

2. Inequalites
Secondly, I want to find out if there are inequalities when it comes to the cost of insurance. The goal is to answer the following questions:
- In which region do people pay more for insurance?
- Does sex influence insurance costs?
- Does having children affect men and women differently when it comes to costs?
